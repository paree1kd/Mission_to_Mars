Web HTML scraping data to create flask application on NASA's work on visiting the planet mars utilizing MongoDB, Python, Bootstrap

## Summary

Project consists of a Python script that scrapes images and texts from specified websites that were discussing on the status of NASA's mission to visit Mars. After collecting the data from the websites, a flask web application is created with a bootstrap designed HTML template to showcase the data. This data was stored in MongoDB. An additional scraping script was connected so that when a button on the HTML page is clicked, the database would be updated with new information related to the mission to Mars. The HTML was also strengthened for other devices by utilizing Bootstrap's style grid system.
